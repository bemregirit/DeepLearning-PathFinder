This is my final graduation project for Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering in Piri Reis University.

My graduation thesis is accessible with ThesisBilalEmreGirit.pdf file.

The project is a python application that helps to find the most feasible way between two choosen point.

The process is made with deep learning library of NEAT-Python. User choses 2 points on the map. And system tries to find 
a way between two points until finding the sussessful way. Finally the founded path is saved in targetCoordinates.py file
for further usages.
